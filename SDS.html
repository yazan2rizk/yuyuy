<h3>1.2	Scope of the development project</h3>
<p>Primarily, the scope contains the E-Store product features for making online medication provider system project.
It focuses on the pharmaceutical company, the pharmacist and buyers, which allow for online sales and quick distribution.
This SRS is also aimed at specifying requirements of software and development of high level learning, user identification
provider and Artificial intelligence (AI), user friendly interfaces in multiple perform and also maintain a well-developed
database with vast amount of medications. This system is composed of two main components: a client-side application which will
run on Android handsets, and a server-side application which will support and interact with various client-side features. The
system is designed to facilitate the process of purchasing medicines and ensuring quick delivery. It is also designed to
maximize buyerâ€™s satisfaction by providing genuine product. More specifically, this system is designed to allow user to
communicate with a group of pharmacists and doctors whenever they need. It facilitates communication between doctors and
user via E-Mail. User can check their medicineâ€™s expiry date by scanning the productâ€™s barcode.</p>

<h3>1.5 Overview of document</h3>

<p><b>Part 2: Architecture -</b>This section explains the system we're planning to 
Develop for and on. It explains the relationships and structure of the project. We tried to show our architecture of MEDILINE
by making a context model.</p>

<p><b>Part 3: Detailed description of Components:</b> This section provides a basic overview of the design procedures
our system's major components.  The tables will demonstrate more details on each component such as database , class library ,
server software , server procedure proxy , client software , android client , desktop client etc.</p>

<p><b>Part 4: User Interface Issues:</b> This section will be divided into three main parts: 
<ul>
      <li>•	The "User's Information & Registration" Section 
      </li>
      <li>•	Shopping Process & Check Out 
      </li>
      <li>•	Suggesting Similar Medicines & Sending Notifications For Refill 
      </li>
      
    </ul>

This section describes the process of how to create account, register & order their medicines through the software,
and also submit pictures or soft copies of their prescriptions. The purpose of this section is to describe how the 
user interfaces allow those people to do their tasks.</p>

<p><b>Part 5: Execution Architecture-</b> This section determines the real-time and performance behavior of a system.
It will cover user login, adding medicines to cart, show receipt to cart, show receipt before checkout, storing 
the list of purchased medicines etc.</p>

<h2> 3.0 Detailed description of components</h2>
<blockquote>
	<h3><b>3.1 Component Overview</b></h3>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
	<p>The following content provides a basic overview of the design procedures our system's major components.&nbsp; The tables will demonstrate more details on each component:</p>
	<ul>
		<li><b> 3.2 Database</b>: We will be using MongoDB as 
		our database software.&nbsp; It will contain tables to represent various 
		project data and will also show relations beteen each and every table. 
		</li>
		<li><b>3.3 Class Library</b>: The Class Library will 
		be a package of classes common to the Server Software and the Client 
		Software.&nbsp; The server software will use these class definitions to know 
		how to store the objects in the database.&nbsp; The client software will use 
		the class definitions in order to ask for and display the correct 
		information about each class type.
		<ul>
			<li>Project class implements SubTask 
			</li>
			<li>ProjectNote class 
			</li>
			<li>TimeDetail class 
			</li>
			<li>ProjectCost class 
			</li>
			<li>Entity class 
			</li>
			<li>Employee class extends Entity 
			</li>
			<li>Supervisor class extends Employee </li>
		</ul>
		</li>
		
		<li><b>3.4 Server Software</b>: Our server software 
		will directly manipulate the contents of the database, based on commands 
		from the Server Procedure Proxy. 
		</li>
		<li><b> 3.5 Server Procedure Proxy</b>: The Server 
		Procedure Proxy will provide an interface for the clients to request 
		information or submit updates to the server. 
		</li>
		<li><b>Client Software</b>:&nbsp; The Client Software will reside on a 
		desktop computer and will be also available on android version.&nbsp; Its purpose is to present data to the 
		user as requested, and provide an interface so that the user can easily 
		update project information.&nbsp; It will handle conflict resolution 
		automatically when possible, and otherwise allow the user to choose 
		which version of an item to keep.
		<ul>
		<li><b> 3.6 Android Client</b>: The Android 
		client will allow the user to view basic information about and make 
		simple changes to data regarding projects assigned to them. 
		</li>
		<li><b> 3.7 Desktop Client</b>: With significantly 
		more computing power, screen size, and storage space than the 
		PocketPC, the desktop client will provide more significant 
		functionality in allowing the user to view and edit project 
		information. </li>
		</ul>
		</li>
	</ul>

			<td><b>Resources</b></td>
			<td>The database we are using which will run on a Windows/Unix 
			based computer. All tables will be created by an administrator (us). 
			We will use the Ingres interface to manually enter initial data in the following tables: Entity, Address, 
			Employee, Supervisor, Customers, Registered Pharmacies,
			System and Contact. Once these are entered, we will use the data 
			held in these fields as a baseline for our user interface. If time 
			permits, we may create a GUI which will allow entry of these parts 
			through our application.<p> Once the server gets a request for 
			a certain data type from a client it will look up the table that is 
			associated with the requested object, then parse the restriction 
			clause and create a valid SQL statement. Once it has generated a 
			valid SQL statement, the server will connect to the database, 
			execute the query and get a PHP ResultSet back. At this point, it 
			will convert the ResultSet to the Object that was requested by the 
			client and send it back to the client via Sockets and ObjectStreams 
			over the network. </p>
			<p>Calls to the database should not take longer than (but should be 
			much less than) 30 seconds and transfers of the each Object over the 
			network should not take longer than 1 minute. Conversion of a 
			ResultSet to a PHP Object should take less than 1 second. Data 
			retrievals in general should be less than 2MB.</p>
			<p>A client may also send an updated object to the server, in this 
			case it will convert to a Set and then do an UPDATE to the database. 
			This is a basic database call so it should not take longer than 1 
			second from start to finish.</td>

			status_cd = &quot;CURR&quot;)</p>
			<p>We will determine the Project class is associated to the project 
			table in the database and it will generate the following SQL 
			statement:</p>
			
			<p>It will send this to the database and will get a PHP ResultSet. 
			A ResultSet is easily converted to our object because the column 
			names in the database will exactly match the fields in our class. 
			For example, in the database we have project_no and employee_id 
			columns, in our class Project we have fields project_no and 
			employee_id.</p>
			<p><b>SQL UPDATE</b> will come from the client in the form 
			Object.update();</p>

			<p>We know for Project that the primary key is project_id so we will 
			create an SQL statement saying:</p>
			<p>UPDATE project set employee_id = 2, user_id = 2....(all fields)

<!--3.0 Detailed description of components ends here (More contents will be added later) -->


     <!--  4.0  Starts Here -->

<h2> 4.0 User Interface Issues </h2>

    <p> The user interface of the Project Tracker will be divided into Two main sections: </p>
    <p> 4.1 The "User's Information & Registration" Section </p>
    <p> 4.2 Shopping Process & Check Out </p>
    <p> 4.3 Suggesting Similar Medicines & Sending Notifications For Refill </p>

    <p> These tools will allow the various users to to create account, register & order their medicines through the software,
        and also submit pictures or soft copies of their precribtions .  The personas described in the SRS
        represent the types of people who will use the app as users - and the purpose
        of this section is to describe how the user interfaces allow those people to do their tasks.
	</p>

<h2> 4.1 The "User's Information & Registration" Section  </h2>

     <p> This application will be used by general people as well as the people
         related with pharmacies & medicines.
	</p>

     <p> It will have the following basic layout: </p>

<h3> 1. Login Screen </h3>
     <p> This first screen will allow users to login to their existed account.
	     User using this app for the very first time hs to create their account
		 from the Ceate New Account Screen
	 </p>

<h3> 2. Create New Account Screen </h3>
     <p> This screen allows A new user to put necessary information about himself & to create
	     his own personal account for free.
	 </p>

     <!--  4.0 Will Still Continue Again From From Here Starting With 4.2 -->

<h2> 4.2 Shopping Process & Check Out </h2>
      <p> This part of the interface deals with the shopping process & also the checkout section.
          It also deals with the VAT & delivary charges depending on the User's location
	  </p>

<h3> 1. Medicines List Screen </h3>
      <p> This screen shows the users the medicines that they can order via online.
	  </p>


<h3> 2. Add To Cart </h3>
      <p> By selecting the medicines the user want to purchase those medicines will be automatically added to the shopping cart.
          The quantity can be changed by the user himself.
	  </p>

<h3> 3. Check Out Screen </h3>
      <p> This screen will show the user the total cost of the medicines including the VAT & the receipt of the purchase also
          include the delivery charge based on the user's location which he used to register his account.
	  </p>

<h3> 4. Purchase Successful Screen </h3>
      <p> This screen will appear after the user press the check out & confirms his crat.
          There will be a dialogue box showing the user that the purchase was successful.
	  </p>

     <!--  4.0 Will Still Continue Again From From Here Starting With 4.3 -->


<h2> 4.3 Suggesting Similar Medicines & Sending Notifications For Refill </h2>

     <p> This section will have options for the user to submit his prescribtion & also suggest him similar medicines
         if the medicine the user is looking for is out of stock.
         This section will also store the user's previous purchase order & keep track of it.
         It will send a sms or notification to the user if he wants to again order medicines.
	 </p>

<h3> 1. Suggesting Similar Medicines </h3>
     <p> If there's a situation where a medicine is out of stock & the user needs that medicine, the application will
         suggest him a similar medicine with "Same Generic Name" to use as an alternative
	 </p>

<h3> 2. Submitting Prescribtion Screen </h3>

     <p> A User can use this feature to upload his prescribtion to store it into the database of the application.
         This will help the user to keep track of his prescribtion even if he somehow lost it or it gets damaged
	 </p>

<h3> 3. Notification Screen </h3>
     <p> This lets any user to know if his medicines are about to be consumed based on his purchase order.
         This will let the user know if he needs to refill his medicines again.
		 The use of Artificial intelligence is used here for this purpose.
	 </p>

<h2>5.0 Execution Architecture </h2>

<p> The execution architecture determines largely the real-time and performance behaviour
of a system .This is small part of the total system architecture .</p>

<h3> " Runtime Environment  and processes " </h3>

<p> As soon as a software program is executed, it is in a runtime state.
In this state we have several query like User Log in ,User's Prescription Submission ,
Adding Medicines To Cart ,Show Receipt Before Checkout, Adding VAT & Delivery cost with
total,Storing The List of Purchased Medicines, Storing The List of Purchased Medicines etc.</p>

<h3> User Login </h3>

<p> User can log in by creating simple account or without creating an account (as guest) . </p>

<h3> Adding Medicines To Cart  </h3>

<p> Whenever a customer select medicine it will save to the cart ,
from there they also can delete .</p>

<h3> Show Receipt Before Checkout (Adding VAT & Delivery cost with total)</h3>

<p> A selecting all of the medicine system will show total
amount with vat and delivery charge.</p>

<h3> Storing The List of Purchased Medicines </h3>
<p> All types of information will save to our database so if a user log in 2nd time to order then can
have similar types suggestion and they don’t need to put their delivery address over and over again </p>


        <!-- End of Execution Architecture -->

<h2>Design decisions and tradeoffs</h2>
<p>
	our goal is to make a system that works rather than look beautiful. That being said we aim to make an UI that’s user friendly and modern. Also, we wanted to make our architecture easy and not too complicated for the sake of easy implementation, as we are short on time. Also, we plan to use a chat box that users can interact. As of now we will only enable some default replies and add more functionality later on. For android app we are only going to give the option to search or pharmacies and medicines. We are not going implement order option in the android app just yet. As a result, users will only be able to look for nearby pharmacies that have the medicines the user searched for. This will be based on android built in GPS system not some custom-built module. So, the accuracy will be around 10 meters or so.
