            <h2>5. Business Strategy</h2>
              <p>
                It’s really important to have a proper business strategy. We must analyze the competition in the online medicine supply sector in order to determine how much effort we’d need for the success of MediLine. Although, our initial belief is that it’s a very low competitive niche we should still dig a little deeper. The Porter's 5 Forces tool will enable us to take the right decision.
              </p>
                  <h3>5.1 Porter’s 5 Forces</h3>
                     <h4>5.1.1 The threat of new entrance:</h4>
                     <p>
                       As we are the pioneers in Bangladesh as an online medicine shop, the new entrance will not affect in our success that much. This only poses a little threat to our success. Moreover, we’d already been well established when/if new competitors come. So, we are very strong in this section
                     </p>
                      <h4>  5.1.2 Threat of a substitute:</h4>
                      <p>
                        Once again, this poses a very little threat. As our goal is to provide quality service for both general users and owners, any new or old substitute would be non-threatening for us. We’d consider our strength to be medium here just for precaution.
                      </p>

                      <h4>5.1.3 Power of suppliers:</h4>
                      <p>  By the end of 6 months, we are confident to have a very good supply chain. So, we are very strong in this sector as well.</p>
                      <h4>5.1.4 Power of Buyers:</h4>
                      <p>
                        We all know how much people like to order stuff from their home. But, there’s no such service for medicine in Bangladesh. That’s why we wish to provide quality service.  This will be really convenient for the users. As a result we are really strong in this sector.
                      </p>
                      <h4>5.1.5 Competitive Rivalry:</h4>
                      <p>
                        Our strongest competitors are the e-commerce sites of Bangladesh. If they get hold of our idea and strategy they can do some damage to our business. However, considering the poor service 99% of the local e-commerce sites provide, it’s a safe bet to say that we can out-compete them.
                      </p>
                  <h3>5.2 Competitive Advantage</h3>
                    <p>
                      As per the traditional market and our research, we do not have any direct competitor. Also, as we are providing convenience over anything else and porter’s 5 forces also gives a green light, we are on the right track as of now. With secure and easy access to all kinds of medicine we can easily establish this business. It’s safe to assume that we are at a competitive advantage.
                    </p>

      <h2>6.OPERATION</h2>
   	  <p>Our Operations are carried out two ways:</p>
   	  <ul>
   	  	<li>Business to Business </li>
   	  	<li>Business to Customers </li>

   	  </ul>


   	  <h3>Business to Business</h3>

   	  <p>
   	  	 In this case, our customers would be the wholesalers and retailers. For making big deals,
         dealing with big companies is a major issue. We will not view our
   	  	 success in terms of how many new customers we can gather but in terms of how deeply we can engage our customers
         with out company. Through this process we are going to be connected with the wholesalers and retailers.

      </p>

    <h3>Business to Customers</h3>

    <p>
    	We will designed our supply chain such a way that we can observe the changes in statistical analysis.
        As hundreds and thousands of customers going to be engaged with the company, doing individual analysis
        would be tough task. Supply chain will figure out what's going on at any point in time with any particular
        type of customers.
    </p>

    <h3>6.1 Value Preposition</h3>
    <p>
    	As "Medline" is a totally new startup, of course value preposition is going to play a vital role for promoting
        this company. For that reason, we are going to put details description, benefits and customers review below any
        product. Search Engine Optimization with highly skillful SEO experts will help to find
    	any particular product from any area with ease. </br>
    	Delivering all products with the shortest time possible would also appear on the site which
        will ensure customers trust on the company which will increase the reliability of the company in both local and
        international market.

    </p>

    <h3>6.2 Milestones</h3>
    <p>
    	"Medline" will have several milestones early on.
    	<ul>
    		<li>Business plan completion. This will be done as guidance for the organization.</li>
    		<li>Office and Data center set up. </li>
    		<li>Highly Secured money transaction</li>
    		<li>Completing hiring initial company officials  </li>

    	</ul>

   </p>


    <h3>6.3 Business Model </h3>
    <p>
    	Since our company going to sell specially medical products and also going to provide medical services,
        we are going to take help from several medical treatment organizations. For that purpose,we have to focus
        both on on Business to  Business and Business to Customers model. Cause 'Medline' needs to deal with also
        good medical service providers. Its AI model going scan the prescriptions of doctors provided by the customers.
        And will be able to recognize the medicines if any customers fail to recognize which medicines are prescribed.



    </p>
   	<h3>6.4 Inventory Management </h3>
    <p>

    	This is a key terms in terms of cost effectiveness. It is the direction and control of activities with the
        purpose of getting the right inventory in the right place at the right time in the right quantity at the right cost.
        We will optimize our supply chain by keeping the inventory level by low by using certain techniques. We will
        maintain lower inventories from 2 hours and 6 hours time slots because these orders are smaller in quantities
        and carry lower inventory costs.



    </p>



                    <h2> 6.5 Refresh Inventory </h2>
                         <p> We are constantly refreshing our inventories (In the app) through the recieved orders and new
                             medicines coming from the users. When a new medicine comes to the store then we update our
                             medicine's list. So, we arecontinuously  refreshing our inventories. </h2>

                    <h2> 6.6 Delivery  Cost </h2>
                         <p> This includes the cost of delivering the medicines from stores to users. A user
                            has to pay the delivery charge when he receives his medicines. </p>

                    <h2> 6.7 Drug Store to another drug store </h2>
                          <p> It includes cost of delivering medicines from one store to other. This will
                              mainly occur when one store is out of medicines and needs those medicines for
                              their store as they have consumers demanding those medicines. </p>

                    <h2> 6.8 Store to Specific Stores & Users </h2>
                          <p> This includes the cost of shipping the products from the stores to the users.
                              If multiple Drug stores are using this app, we can estimate there will be areas where
                              the demand is high and if some medicines will not be available in the nearby Drug stores
                              then one Store can deliver those medicines from the next nearby drug store. </p>
