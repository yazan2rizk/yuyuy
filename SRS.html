    <!--overall description begins from here -->
    <h2>2. Overall Description</h2>
    <p>
      The goal of this section is to give a complete overview of the entire system.
      In this section, we’ll see how the system interacts with the users and other systems that were required to make it work.
      It’ll also describe the functionalities, assumptions, dependencies, and constraints of MediLine.
    </p>

    <h2>2.1 Product perspective</h2>
    <p>
      MediLine is the first ever online shop for medicine in Bangladesh. With this system, users will be able to sell or buy medicine from the comfort of their home.
      There will be two main type of users.
      Buyers and Selles. Buyers are the general people who wish to buy medicine. And sellers are the one who will be constantly updating their collection of medicine.
      After the completion of registration, buyers will have the option to search for medicine.
      If they don’t find the one they are looking for, the system will recommend similar types of medicine for him/her.
      Sellers are essentially the owners/employee of a pharmacy. When they log in, they will be able to upload images and description of the medicine they have.
      These images and descriptions will be saved in a database.
      Later when the search for a certain medicine, the system will search through the database and tell the user whether it’s available or not.
      There will also, be a mobile version of MediLine. Users can search and order for medicine via this app.
      Both the mobile app and website will share the same database.
      The mobile application might not work properly if the hardware is weak For the mobile application, users will be able to search for medicine and nearby pharmacies that provide it. Users are required to fill up certain inputs. Based on the inputs a list of (or map view) pharmacies will be shown on the screen. If the searched item is not available the system will retrieve recommended items from the database and show it on the screen.
      For the website. After users log in to the system. They will be greeted with some suggestions based on their previous search (none if it’s the first time). They can either choose from that list or start a new search. After each search, nearby pharmacies will be shown in the list with the availability of that specific medicine. The user then can easily order by filling up an order form.
      After each order, a notification will be sent to the owner of the pharmacy which was selected when the user filled up the form. Then a representative form that specific pharmacy will make the delivery to the user.
      orm that specific pharmacy will make the delivery to the user.
    </p>

    <h2>2.2 Product functions</h2>
    <p>
      For the mobile application, users will be able to search for medicine and nearby pharmacies that provide it. Users are required to fill up certain inputs. Based on the inputs a list of (or map view) pharmacies will be shown on the screen. If the searched item is not available the system will retrieve recommended items from the database and show it on the screen.
    </p>
    <p>
      For the website. After users log in to the system. They will be greeted with some suggestions based on their previous search (none if it’s the first time). They can either choose from that list or start a new search. After each search, nearby pharmacies will be shown in the list with the availability of that specific medicine. The user then can easily order by filling up an order form.
    </p>
    <p>
      After each order, a notification will be sent to the owner of the pharmacy which was selected when the user filled up the form. Then a representative form that specific pharmacy will make the delivery to the user.
    </p>

      <img src="img/Diagram.png" alt="">
      <h2>2.3 User characteristics</h2>
      <p>
        There will be 3 types of users who can use the system. They are the following.
          <ul>
            <li>General users</li>
            <li>Owners of Pharmacies</li>
            <li>Administrators</li>
          </ul>
        <p>
          General users can use both the website and mobile app. However, they cannot order via the mobile app. They can only search for items and see nearby pharmacies who have that item/s.
        </p>
        <p>
          Pharmacy owners can only use the web app. They can upload images along with a description of a medicine and a number count of that item. Based on these items general users will get to know if an item is available or not.
        </p>
        <p>
          Administrators are the actual owner/ admin of the entire system. They can pretty much do everything. They can add data, delete data or edit data based on the requirement. The admins can manage/modify information for both users and pharmacies.
        </p>
      </p>

      <h2>2.4 Constraints</h2>
      <p>
        The mobile application is constrained by the system interface to the GPS navigation of the hardware. As different manufacturers can make GPS, people will more likely to face inconsistent interface. Based on the device Interface can differ also.
      </p>
      <p>
        Internet connection is also required for all type of users except the admin/s. With an internet connection, the users cannot log in to the system. So, they cannot interact with the system without internet.
      </p>
      <p>
        Another constraint is data capacity. As we are not using our own data center, we are might face issue with capacity.
      </p>


    <h2> 2.5 Documentations</h2>
      <p>N/A</p>
    <h2>2.6 Assumptions and dependencies</h2>
    <p>
      Our main assumption and a matter of worry is, as we are using third party  AI to show customized result to the users, we might find that AI to be incompatible with our system. Or we might not be able to implement all the features related to AI correctly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Another assumption is that as we are using the same database for both the mobile app and web app. We might find some conflicts and unwanted crashes while using the app.
    </p>
    <p>
      Although Laravel is a really powerful framework, we might find some compatibility issue with the AI and the framework.

      <h2> 4.0 Features : </h2>
          // overall features begins from here

     <h2> 4.1 : Personal User Account </h2>

          <p> User can create his/her personal account through which he/she can order for medicines.
              This will allow the application to keep track of the user & also help him in further reminders.
              Users can also sign up via gmail & facebook accounts </p>


    <h2>  4.2 : Friendly User Interface </h2>

           <p> The user interface is very easy to use. Users with very little knowledge on android phone can also use it.</p>

    <h2> 4.3 : Home Delivary System </h2>
          <p> Medicines are delivered to the client's house via home delivary system. Therefore, a patient can easily get his medicine whenever they want.
    Only the delivery charge is needed. </p>

    <h2> 4.4 : User's Ability To Check Expirity Date Of The Medicine </h2>

         <p> The user can check weather the medicine is expired or not via online. He doesn't have to worry about the expirity date of the medicine being expired. </p>

    <h2> 4.5 : Selecting Medicines From Different Supplier Companies </h2>

         <p> User can select similar types of medicine from different suppliers. For example : if a user needs paracitamol, he can order (a) Napa or (b) Ace or (c) Ace plus or (d) Napa Extra.
      So, user has full control over the medicine he needs & can chose from many similar catagories. </p>

     <h2> 4.6 : Easy Return Process </h2>
        <p> If the medicine is damaged, the user can return the medicine and doesn't have to pay for it.

      <h2> 4.7 : Cash On Delivery </h2>
           <p> User can order a medicine & also pay after the delivary.
                This allows the user to double check his orders & see if he is getting the right medicine or not. </p>

    <h2> 4.1.0 Key Features </h2>
    // special features and usage of artificial intelligence begins from here

     <h2>  4.1.1 : Suggesting Medicines with Similar “Generic Names” </h2>
           <p> The user will be suggested with the similar "Generic Name" medicines.
               For example : Ibuprofen(generic name) is used for reating pain, fever, and inflammation
               and has  medicines like "Inflam" as order(in the user's prescription) but there's no "Influm" is stock.
               So, the app will suggest similar medicines like "Influm"
               which are "Reumafen" or "Neoflam" for the patient. </p>

     <h2> 4.1.2 : 24/7 User Support Availability </h2>
           <p> User can order any time or day for medicine.
               There's always someone for user's support.
